    <p><font size="+2"> 13 ART was created based on Jamie, a 13 year old girl, and also my sister. She has a growing passion for the arts and has started painting as of March 2021. She currently paints anime portraits based on anime that she has watched. She is aspiring to study arts in school and growing to become an artist in the future. She has decided to sell her artworks as well for some additional income as we
        come from a family with a single mum that is taking care of 3 kids.  </font></p>
